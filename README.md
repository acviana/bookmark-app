# Bookmark-App

This project is a small bookmarking app built by Alex Viana to explore Cloudflare and frontend tools. The app has 3 parts:

- **Database:** SQLite hosted on [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)
- **API:** TypeScript running on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, Vite, and Shadcn running on [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/)

The project is build as a monolith (calling it a monorepo would be too generous). The code is largely vibe-coded with OpenAI ChatGPT-4o but with an increasing number of human contributions as I learn more TypeScript.
