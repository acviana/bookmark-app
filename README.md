# Bookmark-App

This project is a small bookmarking app built by Alex Viana to explore Cloudflare and frontend tools. The app has 3 parts:

- **Database:** Sqlite hosted on Cloudflare D1
- **API:** Typescript running on Cloudflare Workers
- **Frontend:** Typescript, Vite, and Shadcn running on Cloudflare Pages

The project is build as a monolith (calling it a monorepo would be too generous). The code is largely vibe-coded with ChatGPT-o3 with an increasing number of human contributions as I learn more TypeScript.
